# GIFT Exchange App (legacy)

To help museums (and developers who work for museums) to make use of the [GIFT Platform](https://toolkit.gifting.digital/gift-platform/), we provide the [GIFT Toolbox](https://toolkit.gifting.digital/tools/). The tools in the GIFT Toolbox are split according to the different stages of developing a hybrid gifting experience.

This particular app is a previous version of the [Exchange App](https://github.com/growlingfish/GIFT-exchange). The GIFT Exchange app is a mobile app built on the Ionic Framework, suitable for use on Android devices. The latest version allows users to create, send and receive [hybrid gifts](https://toolkit.gifting.digital/what-are-hybrid-gifts/) via the public instance of the GIFT Platform maintained by the GIFT project. To use the up-to-date version please search for "Gift Exchange tool" on the Google Play store and download the app to your device.

**You are free to browse the source for this legacy version of the app, but _please do not expect it to interact correctly with the GIFT Platform_.**

## The GIFT project

GIFT is a [research project funded by Horizon 2020](https://gift.itu.dk/), exploring hybrid forms of virtual museum experiences. The project brings together artists, designers, museum professionals and computer scientists to help museums create personal encounters with cultural heritage, both in physical and digital realms.
